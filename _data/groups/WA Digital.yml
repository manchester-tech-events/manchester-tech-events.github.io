    Meetups for a community working within the digital scene - we are studios,
    agencies, entrepreneurs, investors, freelancers, contractors, graduates and students
    – comprised of designers, developers, innovators, educators, strategic thinkers,
    consultants & digital tinkerers. We provide opportunities for speakers. Our speakers
    are usually home-grown talent, which provides a support outlet for the local community
    to promote themselves to like-minded professionals. We also have Friday socials
    every other month, which are held on the last Friday of those months.
